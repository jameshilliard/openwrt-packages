# Long description of the package

define Package/yacas/description
	YACAS is an easy to use, general purpose Computer Algebra System, a program for symbolic manipulation of mathematical expressions. It uses its own programming language designed for symbolic as well as arbitrary-precision numerical computations. The system has a library of scripts that implement many of the symbolic algebra operations; new algorithms can be easily added to the library. YACAS comes with extensive documentation (hundreds of pages) covering the scripting language, the functionality that is already implemented in the system, and the algorithms we used.

define Build/Prepare
# The following is a dirty hack. To compile yacas you need to get
# mkfastprimes to run in your host computer. To do so, in Prepare I
# download the tar.gz in pkg_build_dir/temporaryyacas to configure and
# make it to get this mkfastprimes compiled. configure has a problem:
# it generates the Makefile in the current working directory... and cd
# doesn't seem to change it. Thus, it would overwrite the Makefile in
# ports/misc/yacas, a thing which we don't like. To solve it, copy
# Makefile to Makefile2, configure-make and copy it back. The only
# drawback of this approach is that ports/misc/yacas/ gets a little
# full of miscellaneous, unneeded files, generated by configure. Once
# we have mkfastprimes, we copy it to tmp, and then the applied patch
# uses that file. It looks like pwd, export and several other
# constructs don't work under openwrt's build-make environment, that
# is why I just use $(CP) which looks like works correctly.

# To end, copy the yacas binary to sbin, and all yacas scripts to
# sin/yacas-scripts. When you have installed the ipkg you have to add
# sin/yacas-scripts/ to the path, if you don't yacas won't do
# anything. You can also cd to sbin/yacas-scripts and run yacas from
# there. I'll have to check if configure or make has a configuration
# parameter to set the scripts folder.
