# DUMB (mod control)
##############################################################
# You can edit this section to control the playback quality of
# the music in Alex 4.

# dumb_resampling_quality can range from 0 (fastest) to 4 (best).

# dumb_it_max_to_mix is the maximum number of samples DUMB will render at a
# time. 

# Increase buffer_size to combat stuttering.

# The module will be rendered at a sampling frequency specified by sound_freq.
# This variable is also used by Allegro for initialising the sound hardware.

# You can ignore the quality variable. Allegro uses it when relaying the audio
# stream to the sound card. 2 is the maximum, and is only comparable in quality
# to dumb_resampling_quality = 1. Only a masochist would reduce it.
